# CryptoKitty
Java strong cryptography library

CryptoKitty is a Java library intended to provide strong cyptography with a JCE compliant API.

CryptoKitty will also provide a Java Open PGP implementation in compliance with RFC-4880.

All mainstream symmetric and asymmetric ciphers with any key size will be available as well
as signature keys, secure PRNGs, digests, and X.509 DER and PEM certificates.

The library will also provide an exhaustive test suite which will be updated from time to time
with pertinent vectors from FIPS and other sources.

CryptoKitty development began in 2015 and is ongoing.
